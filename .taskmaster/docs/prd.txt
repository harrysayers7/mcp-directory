# MCP Servers Monorepo - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

Build a comprehensive monorepo of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers using the FastMCP library, designed for enterprise-grade deployment with security, scalability, and maintainability as core principles.

## Business Objectives

- Create a unified platform for MCP server development and deployment
- Enable rapid development of new MCP servers with minimal boilerplate
- Ensure enterprise-grade security and compliance standards
- Provide comprehensive documentation and AI assistant integration
- Support independent deployment and scaling of individual servers

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- Monorepo structure with `servers/<name>` folders for individual MCP servers
- Shared `libs/mcp_common` package for common utilities and patterns
- Docker containerization per server with docker-compose orchestration
- Independent CI/CD pipelines for each server
- Modular FastAPI-style architecture for each server

### Security Requirements
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- ASD Essential Eight implementation
- ISO 27001 security controls
- No secrets in code (environment variables + vault integration)
- Automated security scanning (trufflehog, semgrep)
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality and security

### Development Standards
- Python 3.11+ with type hints
- FastMCP framework for all servers
- Pytest for comprehensive testing
- Ruff for linting and formatting
- MyPy for type checking
- Pre-commit hooks for automated quality checks

### Documentation Requirements
- AI assistant integration with `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files
- Comprehensive `docs/ai` folder with diagrams and usage notes
- API documentation for each server
- Deployment and development guides

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Shared Library (`libs/mcp_common`)**
   - Common MCP utilities and patterns
   - Authentication and authorization helpers
   - Logging and monitoring utilities
   - Error handling and validation
   - Configuration management

2. **Individual MCP Servers**
   - Self-contained FastMCP applications
   - Tools, resources, and prompts per server
   - Independent Docker containers
   - Environment-specific configuration
   - Health checks and monitoring

3. **Example Server: Notion MCP**
   - Notion API integration tools
   - Document and database management
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Real-time updates and synchronization

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated testing per server
   - Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
   - Docker image building and registry publishing
   - Independent deployment capabilities
   - Quality gates and approval workflows

5. **Development Tools**
   - Pre-commit hooks for code quality
   - Local development environment with docker-compose
   - Hot reloading for development
   - Comprehensive logging and debugging

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Server startup time < 5 seconds
- API response time < 200ms for 95th percentile
- Support for 100+ concurrent connections per server
- Memory usage < 512MB per server instance

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling support for each server
- Load balancing capabilities
- Database connection pooling
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

### Security
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for all operations
- Regular security updates and patches
- Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Maintainability
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular architecture
- Extensive documentation
- Automated dependency updates

## Success Criteria

1. **Development Velocity**: New MCP server can be created in < 2 hours
2. **Security Compliance**: Pass all security scans and audits
3. **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% test coverage across all servers
4. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and AI assistant integration
5. **Deployment**: Independent deployment of servers without affecting others
6. **Performance**: Meet all performance benchmarks
7. **Maintainability**: Clear code structure and comprehensive documentation

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must use FastMCP framework
- Python 3.11+ requirement
- Docker containerization mandatory
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- PostgreSQL for shared data storage

### Business Constraints
- Enterprise security requirements
- Compliance with multiple security standards
- Budget constraints for cloud resources
- Timeline: MVP in 4 weeks, full production in 8 weeks

### Assumptions
- FastMCP framework stability and performance
- Docker and Kubernetes availability in target environments
- GitHub Actions availability and reliability
- Team familiarity with Python and FastAPI patterns

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- FastMCP framework changes breaking existing servers
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Performance issues at scale

### Medium Risk
- Integration complexity between servers
- Docker orchestration complexity
- CI/CD pipeline reliability

### Low Risk
- Documentation maintenance
- Code quality consistency
- Team learning curve

## Future Considerations

- Support for additional MCP server types
- Integration with other AI platforms
- Advanced monitoring and observability
- Multi-cloud deployment support
- Enterprise SSO integration
- Advanced caching and performance optimization
